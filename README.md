This is the Preschool Activity Tracker. Throughout a normal school day, children are constantly being attended
to for a variety of reasons. Parents and educators alike need to monitor these activites closely to better track
goals, milestones, and basic needs. This app serves as a tool to accurately and easily collect data pertinent to
the daily necessities of each child. Features include:

- Nap Tracker: See when your child took a nap and for how long.
- Meal Tracker: See when and what your child ate today.
- Diaper Tracker: See when your child had their diaper changed and whether it was "number one or number two."
- Daily Report: All of the data points for that day, updated in real time.
                
Each activity is assigned to a Teacher and given a space for notes, to increase accountability and give parents 
greater insight into what their child is experiencing on a daily basis.
